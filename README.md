## ⚙️ Installation

1. Clone the repository:

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/face-clearing.git
cd face-clearing
```

2. Create virtual environment (optional but recommended):

```bash
python -m venv venv
source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows: venv\Scripts\activate
```

3. Install dependencies:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

---

## ▶️ Usage

Run the main file:

```bash
python main.py --image path_to_blurred_image.jpg
```

The enhanced image will be saved in the output folder.

---

## 🧠 How It Works

1. Input blurred image
2. Face detection using OpenCV
3. Image preprocessing
4. Deep learning model enhances facial features
5. Output restored image

---

## 📊 Model Training (Optional)

If you want to train the model:

```bash
python train.py
```

Make sure your dataset is properly structured inside the `dataset/` folder.
